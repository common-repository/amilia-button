The Amilia Button allows you to create a customizable button to redirect your customers to your Amilia Store.

== Description ==

This plugin is deprecated and replaced by the [Amilia Store](https://wordpress.org/plugins/amilia-store/) plugin.

[Amilia](http://www.amilia.com) goes beyond online registration. We make easy for you to get your clients online, not in line by providing you with an online store and a shopping experience that your clients are familiar with. They can add classes, memberships and merchandise to their cart and pay using our simple checkout process. Amilia also simplifies your operations so you can spend less time doing administrative work and more time doing what you love.
